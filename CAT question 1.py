#Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the characteristics of a dataset you have. They tell you what the data shows without making broader claim for examble The average test score in a class of 30 students is 82%.
... #Inferential statistics use sample data to make predictions about a larger population. for example Based on surveying 500 voters, we estimate that 55% of all voters in the state support the candidate.

... #It is a range of values that is expected to include the true population value.
... #When we say 95 percent confidence it means we trust that the real value is inside this range in most cases.
... 
... #3
... #Correlation means two variables are related when one changes, the other change in a way, but causation means one variable directly causes the other to change.
... #correlation doesn't prove causation, for example ice cream sales and drowning deaths are correlated both increase in summer, but ice cream doesn't cause drowning.

... #A probability distribution shows the values a random variable can take and how likely each value is.
... #Discrete distributions deal with separate values like Binomial and Poisson.
... #Continuous distributions deal with ranges like Normal and Exponential.

... #5
... #A population includes every individual or item you want to study.
... #A sample is only a part taken from that population.
... #You can calculate similar measures for both.
... #Population measures use Greek symbols while sample measures use regular letters.
... 
... #6
... #It is a bar chart used with continuous numerical data.
... #The data is grouped into intervals called bins.
... #It helps you understand the overall shape of the data.
... #It shows where most values are centered.
... #It shows how spread out the data is and helps spot unusual values.
... 
... #7
... #Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
... #IQR is the difference between the 75th percentile and 25th percentile.
... 
... #8
... #A frequency distribution shows how often values appear in a dataset.
... #It organizes the data into values or ranges with their counts.
... #It makes large amounts of data easier to understand.
... #It helps you notice patterns trends and the overall shape of the data.
