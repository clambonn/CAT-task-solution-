# shape of distribution
#Left-skewed, Most values concentrate on the right side with a long tail extending to the left.

#spread level
#high spread, values are spread out over a wide range.
#Variance/Standard Deviation change
#If treated as a population, the variance & standard deviation will be smaller.
#cause sample variance uses (n-1) as the divisor instead of N as in population.
#while (n-1) < n, dividing by a smaller number gives a larger result for samples.
